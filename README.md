# useraccounts:materialize

Meteor sign up and sign in templates (and much more!) styled for [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/).

[Demo](https://useraccounts-materialize.meteor.com/) • [Boilerplate with iron:router ](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/boilerplates/tree/master/materialize-iron-router) • [Boilerplate with FlowRouter ](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/boilerplates/tree/master/materialize-flow-router)

This package depends on [useraccounts:core](https://atmospherejs.com/useraccounts/core).

Learn more [here](http://useraccounts.meteor.com) or have a look at the full [documentation](https://github.com/meteor-useraccounts/core/blob/master/Guide.md).


## Bring Your Own Materialize CSS

Adding this package with `meteor add useraccounts:materialize` does not add any other packages providing Materialize CSS. This is to let you choose the flavour you prefer, be it [compiled](https://atmospherejs.com/materialize/materialize), LESS, SASS, or [from CDN](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html)!


At the moment it is up to date with Materialize CSS 0.97.0.
